## Impact of Natural Disasters on Remittance Flow
This project aims to analyze the effect of natural disasters on the flow of remittances. Remittances are financial transfers made by individuals working in foreign countries to their home countries. The project will explore how natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or floods, can disrupt the remittance flow and affect the economies of the recipient countries. By analyzing historical data and using various data analysis and machine learning techniques, the project aims to provide insights into the relationship between natural disasters and remittance flow, which can be valuable for policymakers and organizations involved in disaster management and economic development.
